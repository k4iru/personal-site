    "bio":"I am a Toronto based Full-Stack Developer with experience in a variety of technologies and a passion for learning. I specialize in web development using the MERN stack(Mongodb, Express, React, Node). I also have experience developing applications using languages such as Java, Python, and C++. I strongly believe that Progressive-Web-Apps are the future. As people move away from laptops and desktop computers, smartphones become more essential in everyday life. I aim to deliver a valuable and consistent product across devices at the touch of a finger. My interests include Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Data excites me, and the many possible applications in the future keep me eager to learn the newest technogloy.",
