    "bio":"I am a Toronto based Full-Stack Developer with experience in a variety of technologies. My passion for building started at a young age when I was gifted my first Lego set. I'd spend hours in my bedroom putting blocks together to build robots and whatever else I could think of. Programming, similarly is about taking fundamental concepts and adding those blocks together. Everything starts with the basics, which is why I enjoy experimenting with as many things as possible and expanding my breadth of knowledge. Currently, I specialize in developing using a JavaScript stack. I strongly believe that Progressive-Web-Apps are the future. As people move away from laptops and desktop computers, smartphones become more essential in everyday life. I aim to deliver a valuable and consistent product across devices at the touch of a finger. My interests include Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Data excites me, and the many possible applications in the future keep me eager to learn.",
